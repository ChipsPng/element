Automatic Connections
=====================
It is possible to automatically connect new plugins to Audio and MIDI input/output

- Hold ALT while dropping a plugin, it connects to audio/midi inputs
- Hold CTL (CMD on OSX) while dropping a plugin, it connects to audio/midi outs
- hold ATL + CTL (CMD cmd OSX) while dropping, and it connects to both Input/Output Audio/MIDI
