MIDI Mapping
============
MIDI Controller mapping in Element is quick and easy.  Use the Controller 
Devices editor to add devices, assign controls, and map to plugin parameters.  
The general workflow is as follows:

#. Open Controller Devices, (View -> Controllers)
#. Choose an input device
#. Click the "Learn" Button
#. Map controls by selecting them, and moving a hardware control
#. Map parameters by clicking the "map" button (top right of window)
#. Move a plugin parameter
#. Move a hardware control
