Switching Graphs
================

The active graph can be changed by clicking on it, or by sending a MIDI program 
change.

**Switch Graphs with a MIDI Program Change**

    It is possible to change graphs with MIDI program changes by setting the MIDI 
    Program property of a root graph. To change the MIDI program, follow these steps:

    #. Right click the Graph in the Navigation pane
    #. Choose "Settings" from the menu
    #. Change the MIDI Program from the properties list.

    MIDI Program of 0 disables listening for program changes, while program 1-128 
    enables it for the chosen program* Graph settings can also be accessed from the 
    main menu (View -> Graph Settings)
