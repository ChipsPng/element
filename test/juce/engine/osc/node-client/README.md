# OSC Test Server and Client in Node.js 

## Requirement

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) must be installed, with its package manager, `npm`.

You can download it from the above link to install the latest long-term stable version.

For more flexibility, install [`n`](https://github.com/mklement0/n-install), which allows switching between Node.js versions.

```sh
curl -L https://git.io/n-install | bash
```

## Install dependencies

```sh
npm install # or yarn
```

## Run

```sh
node index
```
